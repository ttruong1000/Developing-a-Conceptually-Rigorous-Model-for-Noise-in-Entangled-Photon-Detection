# Developing a Practical Model for Noise in Entangled Photon Detection
Jupyter Notebooks for generated graphs of the total coincidence probability, error bound, fidelity, and visibility for the paper "Developing a Conceptually Rigorous Model for Noise in Entangled Photon Detection". It is meant to be used as a simulation and visualization tool for analyzing how this system behaves under varying dark count probability, detector efficiency, and average number of photons entering the system.
